# Flash Search ðŸ”¦

Flash is a full-text desktop search engine, designed to help users find their files. Using preprocessing techniques, flash creates an index, allowing searching without having to crawl the filesystem, substantially reducing search times.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

``` sh
git clone git@git.cs.sun.ac.za:20721900/flash.git
```

Move into the flash directory:

``` sh
cd flash
```

Install the program:

``` sh
go install
```

Congrats, you can now use flash! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

Once flash has been installed it can be used as follows:

``` sh
flash [command]
```
